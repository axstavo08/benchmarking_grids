# Benchmarking Grid Popular JS Libraries [![Libraries Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/libraries-test-green.svg)](https://github.com/axstavo08/benchmarking_grids)
This is a small and simple project about the comparison between two popular grid JS libraries: [Kendo UI Grid](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid) and [Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/).

For building this project, I used the trial version of this libraries to show the main features I found necessary for my evaluation.
